# Sinatra Contact Form

A quick Sinatra app that can accept a contact form's POST, verify non-robotness with Google's reCAPTCHA, and send an email with SMTP.

## How it works

This app expects a web form to `POST` the following:

- `name`
- `email`
- `message`
- `g-recaptcha-response`, which is from a [Google reCAPTCHA](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html)

The app will then use the SMTP settings defined in `ENV` variables (see `.env-example`) to send you the form contents in an email.

On success (or captcha fail), users will be redirected to the URLs of your choice (also defined in `ENV` variables).

## Running in development

    shotgun app.rb -p 4567

You will need to save `.env-example` as `.env`, and replace the contents according to your own preferences.

## Deploying to production

I recommend Heroku. If you use them, you'll need to set some environment variables. You can do this from your `.env` file by running this command (Mac only):

    cat .env | sed "s/#.*//" | tr "\n" " " | pbcopy

You then type `heroku config:set ` and paste your clipboard, which will have all the environment variables in the right format for the `heroku` command. (I tried to do this all in one command but it didn't work.)

## Sending email

Try [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com) or one of the similar alternatives for sending email.
